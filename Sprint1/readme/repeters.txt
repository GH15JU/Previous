My roll in this sprint cycle was to work on the UI Mockup as well as the desired functionality portion of the requirement document.

JP and I worked together on the UI mockup in Eclipse, each completing roughly half the work.

Kenneth and I together worked on the desired functionality portion of the requirement document, brainstorming ideas and carefully documenting features we would like to see accomplished.
