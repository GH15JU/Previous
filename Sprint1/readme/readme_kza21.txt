In this sprint cycle we divided the work into roughly two parts. In part 1 I worked with Levent on the general information including domain, problems, storyline, etc.

In part 2 I worked with Ryan on the Desired Functionality in which we both contributed equally and validated eachother's work.

Initially I conceived the basic ideas for the two games, which we further developed and validated as a group.
