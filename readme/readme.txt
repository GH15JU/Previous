During sprint one, I was working on the idea of an application with our team. After we decided on application idea, I started working with Kenneth on specifying problem's domain, problem, subproblems, purpose of our application, and its audience. Then I specified non-functional requirements of our system and got familiarized with GitLab. When this work was done I reviewed and validated documents I was working on. In the end, I installed Android Studio on my laptop. And at last I created this readme file.
